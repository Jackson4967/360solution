Here is a basic explanation of the difference:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SEO aims to improve a website&#8217;s rank in unpaid search results, like Google&#8217;s. Some of the SEO efforts are as follows: keyword studies, on-page optimization, and link building, among others. The aim is to enhance the exposure of your posted web pages to the normal searches carrying relevant keywords.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital marketing is a broader term. It means promoting goods or services using digital technologies. In reality, SEO is part of digital marketing. Other major forms of digital marketing include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>PPC or Pay per click Ads<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Article Marketing (blogging and video etc)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Social media marketing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Email marketing\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mobile\/app marketing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Affiliate marketing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>SEO focuses on getting more organic traffic from search engines. Digital marketing, however, aims to attract visitors using various methods. It also seeks to convert them into buyers and keep them as customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SEO is an element of the digital marketing mix that aims at driving search visibility. Digital marketing is also associated with SEO and other methods for obtaining and retaining customers through the use of the Internet. Both are, in fact, often used simultaneously, as they complement each other for increasing website traffic and sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Choose Webo 360 Solutions For Local SEO Delta BC Services<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You should hire <a href=\"https:\/\/webo360solutions.com\/\">Webo 360 Solutions services for local SEO<\/a> because they offer the solutions to businesses in Delta, BC.
