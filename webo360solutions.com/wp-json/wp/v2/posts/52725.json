HTML 5 is often employed in web design because it allows fast, responsive, and stylish website and app development. It creates the opportunity to create distinctive design options and additions that enrich any online environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Are The Features Of HTML?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Structure Creation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>HTML sets the skeleton for the web documents with the help of CSS and script or any other JavaScript utility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It performs effectively with all the leading browsers and operating systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hyperlinking<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It permits the connection of web pages so that movement from one page to another is facilitated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Support For Multimedia<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It actually embeds images, audio, and video into web pages without the necessity for supplemental links.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Markup Language<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Utilises tags to make the content look well-structured and easy to present.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Responsive Design Support<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It has special elements for the identification of mobile and web designs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Simplified Coding<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Offers readable and clean code that makes it easier to code for the developers who deal with the software.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Integration With Other Technologies<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is very easy to style them with CSS and add interactivity with JavaScript.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Rich Semantics<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Semantic elements such as &lt;article&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and many others are now supported in the Hypertext Markup Language 5 and are useful for reading by the computer and improving SEO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Canvas And SVG Support<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It has the feature of canvas and also the vector-based; graphics such as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) can be drawn directly in the browser.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Local Storage<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Extends them to include support for local storage which actually stores data on the client side without involving the server.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Offline Capabilities<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Offline support is available in web applications through cache facilities in Hypertext Markup Language 5.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For such reasons, HTML remains a convenient and indispensable means of Web site development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Types Of Lists In HTML<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three main types of lists to organize the content in HTML.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ordered Lists<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ordered lists are used where the items are required to be displayed in an organized manner. Use the &lt;ol&gt; tag to create them, and each item in the list is enclosed within the &lt;li&gt; tag. For instance, ordering lists can be used in a recipe or step-by-step instructions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Unordered Lists<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The unordered lists are used when the order of the items is unimportant. These lists are made with the help of &lt;ul&gt; tag, and the items of the lists also contain &lt;li&gt; tag. Common usage is for notes such as the shopping list or types of food, and orders do not matter at all in this case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Definition Lists<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Definition lists are used where one is required to define some terms or offer descriptions for some concepts. They are created by putting into use &lt;dl&gt; tag and terms using &lt;dt&gt; while defining the term using &lt;dd&gt;. This type is perfect for use in glossaries or FAQ sections because it results from the need to include complex text features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Are New Added Elements In Hypertext Markup Language 5?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Semantic Elements<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>&lt;article>: <\/strong>When creating independent content such as a blog or an article.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;section>: <\/strong>So that content can be split into segments.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;header>: <\/strong>For page or section headers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;footer>: <\/strong>For a page or section footer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;nav>:<\/strong> For navigation links.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;aside>:<\/strong> For content like sidebars that may be related to the main content are developed here.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;main>: <\/strong>For the actual information being put on the page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Media Elements<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>&lt;audio>: <\/strong>To embed audio.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;video>:<\/strong> To embed videos.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;source>: <\/strong>To detail multiple media sources To define multiple media sources To identify multiple media sources.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;track>: <\/strong>To sub and CC for videos or audio.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Form Elements<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>&lt;datalist>:<\/strong> Affords a set of predetermined values that may be entered into an input field.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;output>: <\/strong>Shows the outcome of a computation or action taken by a person.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;keygen>: <\/strong>For key generation, which is now no longer supported in some of the current browsers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Graphics And Multimedia<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>&lt;canvas>:<\/strong> Used for drawing graphics using JavaScript programming language.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;svg>:<\/strong> So use for embedding scalable vector graphics.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Interactive Elements<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>&lt;details>:<\/strong> Creates collapsible content.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;summary>: <\/strong>Adds a summary for &lt;details>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;dialog>:<\/strong> For dialog boxes or popups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>New Input Types<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Examples: <\/strong>email, date, time, range, url, color, and so on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Other Useful Elements<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>&lt;mark>: <\/strong>To highlight text.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;progress>: <\/strong>To show task progress.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;meter>: <\/strong>To make a function show values between two numbers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;time>:<\/strong> For dates or times.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&lt;template>: <\/strong>To hold reusable content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Build Stunning HTML5 Websites Effortlessly With Webo 360 Solutions<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Design Professional Websites Without Coding<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At Webo 360 Solutions, we use HTML5 and a drag-and-drop feature.
