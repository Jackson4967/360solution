<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is HTML?</strong></h2>



<p>HTML is the Hypertext Markup Language used in building websites and it is a way of sectioning the text on web pages by using the various graphic distinctions. HTML 5 is often employed in web design because it allows fast, responsive, and stylish website and app development. It creates the opportunity to create distinctive design options and additions that enrich any online environment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Are The Features Of HTML?</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Structure Creation</strong></h3>



<p>HTML sets the skeleton for the web documents with the help of CSS and script or any other JavaScript utility.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility</strong></h3>



<p>It performs effectively with all the leading browsers and operating systems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hyperlinking</strong></h3>



<p>It permits the connection of web pages so that movement from one page to another is facilitated.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Support For Multimedia</strong></h3>



<p>It actually embeds images, audio, and video into web pages without the necessity for supplemental links.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Markup Language</strong></h3>



<p>Utilises tags to make the content look well-structured and easy to present.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Responsive Design Support</strong></h3>



<p>It has special elements for the identification of mobile and web designs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Simplified Coding</strong></h3>



<p>Offers readable and clean code that makes it easier to code for the developers who deal with the software.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Integration With Other Technologies</strong></h3>



<p>It is very easy to style them with CSS and add interactivity with JavaScript.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rich Semantics</strong></h3>



<p>Semantic elements such as &lt;article&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and many others are now supported in the Hypertext Markup Language 5 and are useful for reading by the computer and improving SEO.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Canvas And SVG Support</strong></h3>



<p>It has the feature of canvas and also the vector-based; graphics such as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) can be drawn directly in the browser.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Local Storage</strong></h3>



<p>Extends them to include support for local storage which actually stores data on the client side without involving the server.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Offline Capabilities</strong></h3>



<p>Offline support is available in web applications through cache facilities in Hypertext Markup Language 5.</p>



<p>For such reasons, HTML remains a convenient and indispensable means of Web site development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Types Of Lists In HTML</strong></h2>



<p>There are three main types of lists to organize the content in HTML.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ordered Lists</strong></h3>



<p>Ordered lists are used where the items are required to be displayed in an organized manner. Use the &lt;ol&gt; tag to create them, and each item in the list is enclosed within the &lt;li&gt; tag. For instance, ordering lists can be used in a recipe or step-by-step instructions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Unordered Lists</strong></h3>



<p>The unordered lists are used when the order of the items is unimportant. These lists are made with the help of &lt;ul&gt; tag, and the items of the lists also contain &lt;li&gt; tag. Common usage is for notes such as the shopping list or types of food, and orders do not matter at all in this case.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Definition Lists</strong></h3>



<p>Definition lists are used where one is required to define some terms or offer descriptions for some concepts. They are created by putting into use &lt;dl&gt; tag and terms using &lt;dt&gt; while defining the term using &lt;dd&gt;. This type is perfect for use in glossaries or FAQ sections because it results from the need to include complex text features.</p>
