<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Languages</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HTML</strong></h4>



<p>This is the standard language for creating web pages. HTML gives a structure and format to any web page through the use of icons such as heads, paragraphs, links, and pictures.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CSS</strong></h4>



<p>CSS is employed to add colors and effects to HTML tags. It manages the content color, font, structure, and style of layout of webpages, thus enhancing the attractiveness of any website and user friendly.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>JavaScript</strong></h4>



<p>This is a programming language that supports operations on websites. JavaScript enables the developer to add life to the page&#8217;s content, manage multimedia controls, and interact with users in order to provide an improved experience.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Frameworks</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Front-End Frameworks</strong></h4>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>React</strong></h5>



<p>React is a UI library created by Facebook to build applications, especially single-page applications. It helps developers create reusable UI components.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Angular</strong></h5>



<p>Angular is a powerful framework used to develop complex web applications, and it was designed and developed by Google. One of them is two-way data binding, another one is dependency injection, and modular architecture is also included.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Vue.js</strong></h5>



<p>As a progressive framework for creating user interfaces, Vue.js is simple and versatile. Ideally, it can be combined with other projects and libraries.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Back-End Frameworks</strong></h4>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Node.js</strong></h5>



<p>Node is a JavaScript runtime that is built to let developers use JavaScript on the server end. From my point of view, it is perfect for developing highly scalable network applications.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Django</strong></h5>



<p>It is a Python-based high-level web framework that was described as a &#8216;micro&#8217; web framework, but later, the developers proclaimed it as a &#8216;web micro-framework.&#8217; It has a well-documented &#8216;batteries-included&#8217; approach, which comes equipped with numerous features out of the box.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Responsive Design</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fluid Grids</strong></h4>



<p>Using percentage-based widths instead of fixed pixels allows layouts to adjust based on screen size.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Media Queries</strong></h4>



<p>CSS techniques that apply different styles based on the device&#8217;s characteristics, such as width and orientation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Flexible Images</strong></h4>



<p>Images that adjust according to the layout so that they do not breach the layout or lack quality on larger screen sizes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Version Control</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Git</strong></h4>



<p>A popular system of keeping track of changes in the code with older and newer versions being available. It makes collaborations possible so that several developers can work on a project without question. GitHub and GitLab are the most popular hosting services that offer you the storage of Git repositories and corresponding tools for project management.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Web Hosting</strong></h3>



<p>Website development is followed by web publishing, where the constructed site is stored on a server so that it is available online.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>GitHub Pages</strong></h4>



<p>Works well for hosting static websites directly from homes in GitHub repositories.</p>
